# Basic Data Structures
Many students are usually given bad introduction to data structures. I tried to implement these basic structures both using arrays and linked lists in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand.

Included structures: Stack, Queue, Singly/Doubly Linked List, Binary Search Tree, Heap
There are also some solutions to relevant problems from Leetcode emebeded in the implementations.
The Singly Linked List file contains very clear implementations of various sorting algorithms, also for the purposes of being presented intuitively to L1/L2 students.
