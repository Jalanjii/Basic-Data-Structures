# Data Structures in C

This is a project I did when taking the data structures course. Many students complained about data structures being poorly taught, I tried to implement these basic structures using both arrays & linked lists in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand to fill the gap for some classmates.

Included structures: Stack, Queue, Singly/Doubly Linked List, Binary Search Tree, Heap

There are also solutions to relevant interesting problems from Leetcode emebeded in the implementations.

The Singly Linked List file contains very clear intuitive implementations of various sorting algorithms.
